Connexity is an **open-source evaluation platform for voice AI agents**. It closes the loop between development and production: pull agents from platforms like **Vapi**, **Retell**, and **ElevenLabs** (or build one from scratch), refine their prompts with an AI co-pilot, generate test cases automatically from the agent's own configuration, run evaluations locally or in CI, and push updates back — all from one place.

## 🌀 Core Features

Connexity is built around a single closed loop for developing voice AI agents — **import or build → edit → test → evaluate → deploy → iterate**.

- **Agent versioning** — work freely on a draft of your agent's prompt, tools, and configuration. When you're happy with the changes, capture them as an immutable version with an optional changelog. Past versions are kept so you can compare runs, roll back, or branch off them.

- **AI-assisted prompt editor** — collaborate with an AI agent that knows your current prompt, tools, and past evaluation results to draft, critique, and rewrite prompts faster than you would by hand.

- **Test case generation** — Connexity reads the agent's own system prompt and tool definitions and generates a diverse batch of multi-turn test cases. Each generated case ships with a persona, an opening message, expected outcomes for the judge, and the tool calls the agent is expected to make. *(An interactive AI test-case agent is on the roadmap.)*

- **Agent evaluation** — run multi-turn simulations against your agent, scored by an LLM-as-judge with custom metrics, full transcripts, tool-call traces, and per-turn cost / token accounting.

- **CLI for CI/CD** — automate evaluation in GitHub Actions and other pipelines: every PR can run a regression suite against your agent and fail the build on quality, cost, or latency regressions.

- **Agent deployment** *(coming soon)* — push approved versions back to the source platform (Vapi, Retell, ElevenLabs) directly from Connexity, so the same artifact you evaluated is the one that goes live.

Together these pieces form a **closed development loop**: import or build → edit → test → evaluate → deploy, then start over with real-world data.

## 🛠 Deploy Connexity

Run Connexity on your own infrastructure. Two deployment paths are supported today:

### Local (Docker Compose)

Run the entire stack on your own machine in a few minutes using Docker Compose. Recommended for development and evaluation.

```bash
# Get a copy of the latest Connexity repository
git clone https://github.com/Connexity-AI/connexity-evals.git
cd connexity-evals

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env
cp frontend/apps/web/.env.example frontend/apps/web/.env

# Start everything in Docker (frontend, backend, database, adminer)
make docker-up
```

Then open the dashboard at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### VM

Run Connexity on a single Virtual Machine using the same Docker Compose stack. Suitable for small teams and internal deployments — clone the repo on your VM, set production secrets in `.env`, and run `make docker-up`. See the [`docs/`](./docs) folder for hardening and configuration tips.

## 🪢 Integrations

Connexity is designed to live alongside the voice AI platforms you already use. First-class adapters for major voice platforms are in active development.

### Voice platforms

| Platform        | Status         | Description                                                                                                                  |
| --------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vapi**        | *Coming soon* | Import agents from your Vapi workspace into Connexity, version and evaluate them, then push updates back to Vapi.            |
| **Retell**      | *Coming soon* | Two-way sync with Retell — pull existing agents, run evaluations against them, and deploy approved versions back to Retell.  |
| **ElevenLabs**  | *Coming soon* | Two-way sync with ElevenLabs Conversational AI agents, including prompt, tools, and configuration.                           |

### Bring your own agent

You don't need to be on one of the integrated platforms to use Connexity. There are two ways to plug your agent in:

- **Platform-side simulation** — define your agent directly in Connexity (system prompt, tools, model, provider, temperature) and Connexity will simulate it end-to-end alongside the user simulator using its built-in agent runner. No separate hosting required.
- **External URL** — point Connexity at any agent that speaks the [Agent HTTP contract](./docs/agent-contract.md) — an OpenAI-compatible chat messages payload over a single `POST /agent/respond` endpoint. Framework-agnostic; see [`examples/integrations/`](./examples/integrations) for runnable Python and LangChain starters.

### CLI *(in development)*

A standalone CLI package is in active development to make it easy to drive evaluations from CI (e.g. GitHub Actions). For now, the CLI ships inside the backend and can be invoked via `make cli ARGS="..."`.

## 🚀 Quickstart

The end-to-end developer loop in Connexity looks like this:

> **Run the platform → Import an agent (Vapi / Retell / ElevenLabs) or build one from scratch with the prompt agent → Generate test cases → Run an evaluation → Inspect results.**

### 1️⃣ Run the platform

The fastest way is the all-in-one Docker stack:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Connexity-AI/connexity-evals.git
cd connexity-evals

cp .env.example .env
cp frontend/apps/web/.env.example frontend/apps/web/.env

make docker-up
```

| Service   | URL                                                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dashboard | [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)                 |
| API docs  | [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)       |
| Adminer   | [http://localhost:8083](http://localhost:8083)                 |

Sign in with the seeded superuser (configured in `.env`):

| Field    | Value               |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| Email    | `admin@example.com` |
| Password | `password`          |

> Prefer running the app natively with the DB in Docker? Use `make install && make db && make db-seed && make dev` and `make dashboard` in another terminal. See `make help` for all targets.

### 2️⃣ Bring an agent into Connexity

Pick one:

- **Import from a voice platform** *(coming soon)* — connect your **Vapi**, **Retell**, or **ElevenLabs** account and pull an existing agent, including its prompt, tools, and configuration.
- **Build from scratch with the AI prompt editor** — start a new agent and let the AI co-pilot help you draft the system prompt, tools, and persona.
- **Point at any HTTP endpoint** — register an existing agent that implements the [Agent HTTP contract](./docs/agent-contract.md). See [`examples/integrations/`](./examples/integrations) for runnable Python and LangChain starters.

Edits are kept as a draft on the agent. When you're ready, capture the draft as a new version (with an optional changelog) — that version is what evaluations and deployments are pinned to.

### 3️⃣ Generate test cases

From the dashboard, generate a batch of test cases for your agent. Connexity reads the agent's system prompt and tool definitions and produces diverse multi-turn scenarios — happy paths, edge cases, and adversarial / red-team cases — each with a persona, an opening message, expected outcomes, and the tool calls the agent is expected to make.

### 4️⃣ Run an evaluation

Run the test cases against your agent. Connexity simulates the user side, lets your agent execute its own tool loop, and records full transcripts, tool calls, token usage, latency, and cost.

For automation in CI, use the CLI *(in development)* — for example, in a GitHub Action that runs the regression suite on every PR and fails the build on quality regressions.

### 5️⃣ Inspect results

In the dashboard you can:

- Compare runs across agent versions and prompts
- Drill into per-turn transcripts, tool calls, and judge verdicts
- Track cost and latency trends
- Promote a version for deployment *(deployment back to source platforms coming soon)*
